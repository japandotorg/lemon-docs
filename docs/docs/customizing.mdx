# MDX and React

## Using JSX in Markdown

This documentation is built using Docusaurus, and it has built-in support for [MDX](https://mdxjs.com).
Which allows users to write Javascript XML within your markdown files and render them as React components

:::note

While both `.md` and `.mdx` are parsed using MDX, some of the syntax are treated slightly differently.
For the most accurate parsong and better editor support,
I recommend using the `.mdx` extension for files containing MDX syntax

:::

:::caution

MDX is **not** completely compatible with **CommonMark**.
Use the **MDX playground** to ensure that your syntax is valid MDX

:::

### Example:

```jsx
export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: '#0c0c0c',
      padding: '0.1rem',
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

<Highlight color="#fbfb04"LEMON</Highlight> and <Highlight color="#fc8eac">FLAMINGO</Highlight> are my favorite color

I can use **jsx** with <u> markdown </u>
```

Notice how it renders both the markup from your React component and the Markdown syntax:

```mdx-code-block
export const Highlight = ({children, color}) => (
  <span
    style={{
      backgroundColor: color,
      borderRadius: '2px',
      color: '#0c0c0c',
      padding: '0.1rem',
    }}>
    {children}
  </span>
);

<BrowserWindow minHeight={240} url="http://localhost:3000">

<Highlight color="#fbfb04">LEMON</Highlight>
{` `}and <Highlight color="#fc8eac">FLAMINGO</Highlight> are my favorite color

I can use **jsx** with <u> markdown </u>

</BrowserWindow>
```
<br />

:::note

You can also import your own components defined in other files or third-party components installed via npm
Check out the [docs](https://mdxjs.com) to see what other fancy stuff you can do with MDX

:::

:::caution

Since all doc files are parsed using MDX, any HTML is treated as JSX.
Therefore, if you need to inline-style a component, follow JSX flavor and provide style objects.

:::

## Importing code snippets

You can not only import a file containing a component definition, but also import any code 
file as raw text, and then insert it in a code block, thanks to [webpack raw-loader](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/raw-loader/).
In order to use `raw-loader`, first you need to install it in your project as follows:

```mdx-code-block
import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
<TabItem value="npm" label="npm" default>

```bash
npm install --save raw-loader
```

</TabItem>
<TabItem value="yarn" label="yarn">

```bash
yarn add raw-loader
```

</TabItem>
</Tabs>


Now you can import code snippets from another file as follows:

<!-- prettier-ignore-start -->
```jsx title="myFile.mdx"
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import MyComponentSource from '!!raw-loader!./_myComponent';

<CodeBlock className="language-jsx">{MyComponentSource}</CodeBlock>
```
<!-- prettier-ignore-end -->

```mdx-code-block
import CodeBlock from '@theme/CodeBlock';
import MyComponentSource from '!!raw-loader!../../src/components/Tabs/_myComponent';

<BrowserWindow url="http://localhost:3000">

<CodeBlock className="language-jsx">{MyComponentSource}</CodeBlock>

</BrowserWindow>

<br />
```
You can also pass `title` prop to `CodeBlock` component in order to appear it as header above your codeblock as follows:

```jsx
<CodeBlock className="language-jsx" title="/src/myComponent">
  {MyComponentSource}
</CodeBlock>
```

:::note

You have to use `<CodeBlock>` rather than the Markdown triple-backtick `````, because the latter wuth ship out any of it's content as-is, 
but you want JSX to insertthe imported text here.

:::

:::warning

This feature is experimental and might be subject to API breaking changes in future.

:::

## Importing Markdown

You can use Markdown files as componentsand import them elsewhere, either in Markdown files 
or in React pages. 

By convention, using the **`_` filename prefix** will not create any doc page and means the markdown file is a 
**partial**, to be imported by other files.

```md title="_partial-example.mdx"
<span>Hello {props.name}</span>

This is text some content from `_partial-example.mdx`.
```

```jsx title="someOtherDoc.mdx"
import PartialExample from './_partial-example.mdx';

<PartialExample name="LEMON" />;
```

```mdx-code-block
import PartialExample from './_partial-example.mdx';

<BrowserWindow url="http://localhost:3000">
  <PartialExample name="LEMON" />
</BrowserWindow>

<br />
```

:::caution

The table-of-content does not currently contain the imported Markdown headings. 
This is a technical limitation that **Docusaurus** is trying to solve
